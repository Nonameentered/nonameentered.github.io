This is a largely unordered list of reading recommendations separated into categories. Works may appear in multiple categories. In the future, I may write more descriptions and longer posts about the listed works.

# Favorites
### Hunger of Memory
Amazing memoir describing Rodriguez's experience growing up in a working-class immigrant household.  While Rodriguez makes interesting arguments against bilingual education and affirmative action, I do not believe I agree with them and may address these points later. What hits closest to home for me are Rodriguez's descriptions of family life and the damaging consequences of upward mobility.
### The Years That Matter Most: How College Makes or Breaks Us
Provides a detailed overview of the American education system from primary school all the way through college and beyond. In this book, we are exposed to the inequity throughout the educational system as well as effective and ineffective tactics for leveling the playing field. The book provides a spectacular fact-based argument against standardized testing (particularly the SAT) because of the extreme socioeconomic inequalities attached to the test.
### Let America Be America
Langston Hughes poem describing the realities of modern life and the promise of a better America.
### Asian American Achievement Paradox
This book changed my understanding for how to explain why Asian American as a whole have been so successful in America. Asian American success is neither purely the result of socioeconomic wealth nor essential cultural values, but rather a much more complex situation resulting from education-based immigration policies, ethnic institutions, and stereotype promise.
